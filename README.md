# 🏃‍♂️ AI Performance Analyzer for Athletes

This project is built as part of our Advanced Financial Modeling (AFM) group course. It uses AI and data analysis to evaluate athletic performance based on various inputs and metrics.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a tool that:
- Accepts athletic data (e.g., speed, agility, strength).
- Uses a predictive model to analyze and rate performance.
- Outputs an efficiency or "readiness" score for coaches and athletes to interpret.

## 💡 Features
- Python-based backend
- Reads `.xlsx` data files with athlete stats
- Core logic in `app.py` and `app_updated.py`
- Outputs performance ratings per user
- Easily upgradable for ML model integration
